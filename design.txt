Design:
	1. ERC721 Collection for Gen. 1 Eggs and Birds: Staking for the egg to hash will be non-custodial
    (NFT stays in user wallet) and will happen in this SC. Staking for Breeding will be custodial and will happen in the Gen. 2 Smart Contract
	2. ERC721 Collection for Gen. 2 Eggs and Birds: Staking for the egg to hash will be non-custodial(NFT stays in user wallet) and will happen in this Sc. 
    Staking for Breeding will be custodial and will happen in the Gen. 3 Smart Contract.
 	3. And so on…
	4. Elemental Stones will be a 3rd SC, users can just buy from here.(if you want different designs for each stone we’ll make it ERC721,
    if stones are like a currency, so all the same we’ll make it ERC1155).
	5. ERC721 SC for Gen. 1 Elemental Eggs and Birds. To mint, users have to Stake here one Elemental Stone and 2 Birds => Elemental Egg.
    Staking for the egg to hash will be non-custodial(NFT stays in user wallet) and will happen in this Sc. Staking for Breeding will be custodial 
    and will happen in the Gen. 2 Elemental Birds Smart Contract.
